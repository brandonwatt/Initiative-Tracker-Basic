Incorporeal
Immune to nonmagic attacks, 1/2 dmg from magic, except force.

Creatures with the incorporeal condition do not have a 
physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all 
nonmagical attack forms. Incorporeal creatures take half 
damage (50%) from magic weapons, spells, spell-like 
effects, and supernatural effects. Incorporeal creatures 
take full damage from other incorporeal creatures and 
effects, as well as all force effects.
