Slow
-1 atk, AC, Reflex Saves. One action only, no full-round. 1/2 Speed.

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically 
slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are 
staggered and can take only a single move action or 
standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take 
full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a –1 penalty 
on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature 
moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 
5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping 
distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple slow effects don't stack. 
Slow counters and dispels haste.
