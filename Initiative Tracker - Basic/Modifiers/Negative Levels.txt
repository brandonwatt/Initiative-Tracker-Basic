Negative Levels
-1 per lvl to atk, CMB, CMD, saving throws, skill/abili checks.

For each negative level a creature has, it takes a 
cumulative –1 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls,
combat maneuver checks, Combat Maneuver Defense, saving 
throws, and skill checks. In addition, the creature 
reduces its current and total hit points by 5 for each 
negative level it possesses. The creature is also treated 
as one level lower for the purpose of level-dependent 
variables (such as spellcasting) for each negative level 
possessed. Spellcasters do not lose any prepared spells or
slots as a result of negative levels. If a creature’s 
negative levels equal or exceed its total Hit Dice, it 
dies.

A creature with temporary negative levels receives a new 
saving throw to remove the negative level each day. The DC
of this save is the same as the effect that caused the 
negative levels.
