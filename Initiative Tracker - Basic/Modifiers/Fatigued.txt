Fatigued
-2 Str & Dex, can't run or charge.

A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes 
a –2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything 
that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued 
character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete 
rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
